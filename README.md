## A Python program estimating the speed of the ISS's orbit of Earth

This project aims to achieve the following goals:
- The program should produce a numeric output of the average velocity of the ISS
- The program should produce a .txt file as described in the [Mission Space Lab creator guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/mission-space-lab-creator-guide)
- The numeric output should use no more than 5 significant numbers
- The speed must be given in kilometres per second
- The program should measure the average linear speed that the ISS is travelling around the Earth, not how much the ISS is rotating.
